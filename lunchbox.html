      <h1 class="lunchbox-header-title">Scalable Food Tech</h1>
      <p class="lunchbox-header-text">At Lunchbox, we were a fast-growing food tech startup. As the company expanded into other sectors of the food industry, our designs couldn’t keep up with the vast demand from our users and restaurant partners. The Product team set out to redefine the online ordering space by creating a new scalable product that would rival our competitors and be used by our 100+ restaurant partners. </p>
      <p>I was a part of this immense overhaul, taking full ownership of the Native App Redesign.</p>

      <h2 class="lunchbox-title">The Need For A Better Product</h2>
      <p class="lunchbox-text">Lunchbox’s mission is to empower restaurants to take back their digital presence. With 3rd party apps such as Grubhub, Doordash, and Uber Eats, Lunchbox was a way for restaurants to have their own online ordering platform without having to rely on 3rd party apps.
      </p>

      <p class="lunchbox-text">Now you might be wondering, what’s wrong with 3rd party apps? The biggest issue is the high fees they incur, sometimes taking over 30% of the restaurant’s profits as well as the lack of brand identify for restaurants. Lunchbox aimed to solve this issue by offering a fixed monthly fee, providing a product that was exclusive to our restaurant partners, and giving restaurants access to the data we collect.
      </p>

      <p class="lunchbox-text">
        As we expanded, the product couldn’t keep up with the demand of our restaurant partners. What was originally designed to handle a couple of restaurants was now being used by over 100+ restaurants. The product just wasn’t scalable. 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="challenge section-container">

      <h2 class="lunchbox-title">The Challenge</h2>
      <p class="lunchbox-text">This redesign’s purpose was to create an amazing user experience that would encapsulate all of our restaurant partner’s needs. We weren’t just changing the look but the feel as well. This project was going to set a foundation for our product that would embrace the ever-changing industry.
      </p>

      <p class="lunchbox-text">Our goal for this redesign was not to redo everything from scratch. As we had a very short timeline of 3 months, we wanted to focus on core areas where we could improve the product’s scalability and user experience. With these criteria in mind, the product team set out to identify these core issues through research and data.
      </p>

      <p class="lunchbox-text lunchbox-list">
        What we wanted to accomplish with this redesign. 
        <ol>
          <li>Create a product that would scale for any restaurants we sign.</li>
          <li>Allow for customization and branding without sacrificing user experience.</li>
          <li>Design an experience that would rival our competitors.</li>
        </ol>

      <h2 class="lunchbox-title">My Role</h2>
      <p class="lunchbox-text">I was tasked with leading the Native App Designs. I worked closely with two other Product Managers, my Design Lead, and Native App Developers to discover core problems that this redesign would address. </p>
      <p class="lunchbox-text">
        I designed the entire App experience and had full ownership of the modifier redesign. I was also involved in redesigning web and different features such as Location Picking and the Checkout Flow.

      <h2 class="lunchbox-title">Understanding Our Restaurant Partners
      </h2>
      <p class="lunchbox-text">The first step was understanding our clients. In order to select which clients we would interview, we decided to examine which ones were doing well and which weren’t, based on revenue and site traffic. We looked at our top 5 restaurants and the bottom 5 that had launched within the past 6 months. We spoke with all of them to understand their challenges and pain points. Here were the main takeways from that research group.
      </p>
        <div class="research-grid">
          <div class="research-card">
            <h3 class="research-title">Long Scrolling Modifications</h3>
            <p class="lunchbox-text">Restaurant Partners felt that setting up their menus to allow customizations made the menu items long and tedious to scroll through. Designs didn’t accommodate all use cases of modifying a menu item.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="research-card">
            <h3 class="research-title">Checkout Flow</h3>
            <p class="lunchbox-text">Restaurant Partners compared our checkout flows to some of our competitors and wanted the same features that they offered on their checkout screens. 
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="research-card">
            <h3 class="research-title">A Better User Experience</h3>
            <p class="lunchbox-text">Something that came up with all restaurant partners we interviewed was the need to create a better experience for guests. They felt that the product wasn’t keeping up with the growing industry.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="research-card">
            <h3 class="research-title">Branding & Customization</h3>
            <p class="lunchbox-text">Whenever a restaurant goes through a rebrand, it would require a designer and developer to update the product. Restaurant Partners wanted a way where they could do it themselves without having to contact someone from Lunchbox to update it for them.

    <div class="understand-users section-container">

      <h2 class="lunchbox-title">Understanding Our Users</h2>
      <p class="lunchbox-text">The next step was user interviews and user testing. We wanted to understand the challenges our users faced when using the product and see for ourselves what actions users would take when faced with a problem. We hosted a workshop with PM's and Developers to highlight areas of the product that we could test with users. Here were the key takeaways from that research.
      </p>
        <div class="research-grid">
          <div class="research-card">
            <h3 class="research-title">Location Picking</h3>
            <p class="lunchbox-text">Users had a hard time sharing their location. Inputting zip codes or areas yielded no help. Users didn’t like that they had to input their exact address when selecting a location just to see the menu. They compared it to other delivery apps that didn’t have this requirement. Users mainly wanted to get to the menu ASAP and location picking was a major bottleneck for them.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="research-card">
            <h3 class="research-title">Modifications Were Frustrating</h3>
            <p class="lunchbox-text">Users that were tasked with modifying a menu item found it difficult and time-consuming. Users that had dietary restrictions were frustrated that for certain menu items they were unable to remove or replace the ingredient that they could not eat.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="research-card">
            <h3 class="research-title">Checkout Experience</h3>
            <p class="lunchbox-text">Users didn’t like that in order to checkout they needed to signup for an account. They pointed out that many places allowed for guest checkout. They were also unhappy with the fact that linking their payments required opening up multiple pages. Apple or Google Pay was brought up numerous times.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="research-card">
            <h3 class="research-title">Why First-Party Apps?</h3>
            <p class="lunchbox-text">Users who used first party applications were supporters of the restaurant. They like the fact that menu items were cheaper on the Lunchbox platform and that every order gave them loyalty points to use on their next order. They felt they had a more personalized experience as opposed to third party apps.

      <h2 class="lunchbox-title">Identifying Areas Of Improvement</h2>
      <p class="lunchbox-text">From our interviews with our restaurant partners and users, it was quite clear that there were 3 areas of the product that needed improvement.
        <ol>
          <li>An easier way for users to share their location</li>
          <li>Better designs for modifiers that are simple and easy to use.</li>
          <li>A quicker way for users to checkout.</li>

      <p class="lunchbox-text">With these 3 areas, we went to our database to evaluate each of them. What we found backed a lot of what our restaurant partners and users had told us during the interviews</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Users who shared their location were 2x more likely to place an order.</li>
            <li>There was a 10% conversion rate for those who didn’t share their location and a 21% conversion rate for those who did.</li>
            <li>Only 2% of web users shared their location and an astonishingly low 0.6% of users shared their location on Native App. (600,000+ total users with only about 12,000 users who shared their location)</li>
            <li>On average it took 6 minutes and 32 seconds for a user who shared their location to place an order compared to 7 minutes and 20 seconds for those who didn’t.</li>

          <h3 class="research-title">Modifiers</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Menu Items with less than 6 modifications were at the top of best-selling items.</li>
            <li>Users who clicked into menu Items with more than 6 modifications only had a 20% add-to-cart rate.</li>
            <li>Users who did successfully add a menu item with 6 or more modifications took an average of 2 minutes per menu item.</li>
            <li>Salads, Pizzas, & Bowls, ones with the most customization and modifiers, were the top most abandoned menu items at over 70% abandonment. </li>
            <li>The “Special Request” comment feature was most often used to remove ingredients from menu items.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="research-title">Checkout</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Once users had made it to the checkout page we had a 55% conversion rate.</li>
            <li>We had a 72% conversion rate for users who had ordered in the past.</li>
            <li>Over 50% of guests quit the application once they hit the “Login To Checkout Page.”</li>
            <li>Restaurants that offered Apple Pay or Google Pay had higher conversion rates than those that didn’t, over 25% more. </li>
